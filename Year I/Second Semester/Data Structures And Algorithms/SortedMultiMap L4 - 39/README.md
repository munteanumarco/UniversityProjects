Implement ADT SortedMultiMap using a hashtable with open addressing and double hashing in which unique keys are stored with a dynamic array of the associated values.In the constructor of the  iterator  create  a  sorted  array  of  (key,  dynamic  array  of  values)  pairs  and  use  it  for iterating.
