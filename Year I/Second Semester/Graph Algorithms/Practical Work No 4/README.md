# Practical Work No 4
Write a program that, given a graph with costs, does the following:
<ul>
  <li>verify if the corresponding graph is a DAG and
    performs a topological sorting of the activities using the algorithm
    based on depth-first traversal (Tarjan's algorithm);
  </li><li>if it is a DAG, finds a highest cost path between two given vertices,
    in O(m+n).
</li></ul>
